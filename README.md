realtime_chat
=============

a real time nodejs chat module that translates to a specified language. 

Issues:
* Doesn't accept non-english input for some reason when running through translation API. I'll try to fix this first.
* multpile users inputting things at the same time seems to do weird things to the server.
* looks like a 5 year old from the 80's designed it's css.
