realtime_chat
=============

a real time nodejs chat module that translates to a specified language. 

Todo list:
* Multi-chatroom options:
* Work it to be interfaced with databases
*Proper CSS
Issues:
* multpile users inputting things at the same time seems to do weird things to the server.
* looks like a 5 year old from the 80's designed it's css.
